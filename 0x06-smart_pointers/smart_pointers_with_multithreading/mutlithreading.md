# Multithreading with Smart Pointers
### 1. **Understanding Threads**

A **thread** is the smallest unit of processing that can be scheduled by an operating system. A multithreaded program contains multiple threads that execute independently but can also share resources such as memory.

### 2. **Benefits of Multithreading**

- **Improved Performance:** By executing multiple threads simultaneously, programs can complete tasks faster, especially on multi-core processors.
- **Responsiveness:** Multithreading allows a program to remain responsive to user inputs while performing background tasks (e.g., in GUI applications).
- **Resource Sharing:** Threads within the same process can share memory and resources, making communication and data exchange easier.

### 3. **C++ Thread Library**

C++11 introduced a standard thread library that provides classes and functions for creating and managing threads. The main components include:

- **`std::thread`:** Represents a single thread of execution.
- **`std::mutex`:** A mutual exclusion object used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads.
- **`std::lock_guard`:** A RAII-style mechanism for managing mutex locks.
- **`std::condition_variable`:** A synchronization primitive that allows threads to wait for certain conditions to occur.
- **`std::future` and `std::promise`:** Facilitate asynchronous programming and allow communication between threads.

### 4. **Creating and Managing Threads**

#### Basic Thread Creation

You can create a thread using `std::thread` by passing a callable object (function, lambda, or functor) and its arguments.

**Example: Basic Thread Creation**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void hello() {
    std::cout << "Hello from thread: " << std::this_thread::get_id() << "\n";
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(hello); // Create a thread running the `hello` function
    t1.join(); // Wait for the thread to finish
    std::cout << "Hello from main thread: " << std::this_thread::get_id() << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### 5. **Joining and Detaching Threads**

- **Joining a Thread:** The `join()` member function blocks the calling thread until the thread represented by `std::thread` finishes execution.
- **Detaching a Thread:** The `detach()` member function allows the thread to run independently from the main thread. After detachment, the thread cannot be joined.

**Example: Joining and Detaching Threads**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>

void printMessage() {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
    std::cout << "Message from thread: " << std::this_thread::get_id() << "\n";
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(printMessage); // Create a thread
    t1.detach(); // Detach the thread to run independently

    // The main thread continues running
    std::cout << "Main thread is doing other work...\n";
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));

    return 0; // The detached thread may still be running when main exits
}
```

### 6. **Synchronization**

When multiple threads access shared resources, synchronization is essential to prevent data races and ensure thread safety.

#### Using `std::mutex`

`std::mutex` is a synchronization primitive that allows only one thread to access a resource at a time.

**Example: Synchronizing Access to Shared Data**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
#include <mutex>

std::mutex mtx; // Mutex for protecting shared data
int sharedCounter = 0; // Shared resource

void incrementCounter() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx); // Lock the mutex
        ++sharedCounter; // Critical section
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;

    // Create multiple threads
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        threads.emplace_back(incrementCounter);
    }

    // Join all threads
    for (auto& th : threads) {
        th.join();
    }

    std::cout << "Final counter value: " << sharedCounter << std::endl; // Should be 10000
    return 0;
}
```

### 7. **Condition Variables**

Condition variables allow threads to wait until a certain condition is met, enabling more complex synchronization patterns.

**Example: Producer-Consumer Problem Using Condition Variables**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <queue>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <mutex>
#include <chrono>

std::queue<int> dataQueue; // Shared queue
std::mutex mtx; // Mutex for protecting shared data
std::condition_variable cv; // Condition variable for synchronization

void producer() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100)); // Simulate work
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        dataQueue.push(i);
        std::cout << "Produced: " << i << "\n";
        cv.notify_one(); // Notify one waiting consumer
    }
}

void consumer() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        cv.wait(lock, [] { return !dataQueue.empty(); }); // Wait until the queue is not empty
        int data = dataQueue.front();
        dataQueue.pop();
        std::cout << "Consumed: " << data << "\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread prodThread(producer);
    std::thread consThread(consumer);

    prodThread.join();
    consThread.join();

    return 0;
}
```

### 8. **Futures and Promises**

`std::future` and `std::promise` are used for asynchronous programming. A `std::promise` is a way to store a value that a `std::future` will eventually obtain.

**Example: Using Future and Promise**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <future>

void calculate(int x, std::promise<int>&& p) {
    int result = x * 2; // Some calculation
    p.set_value(result); // Set the result in the promise
}

int main() {
    std::promise<int> prom; // Create a promise
    std::future<int> fut = prom.get_future(); // Get the associated future

    std::thread t(calculate, 10, std::move(prom)); // Start the thread

    std::cout << "Waiting for result...\n";
    int result = fut.get(); // Wait for the result from the future
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << "\n";

    t.join(); // Wait for the thread to finish
    return 0;
}
```

### 9. **Thread Safety with Smart Pointers**

Smart pointers (`std::shared_ptr`, `std::unique_ptr`) can also be used safely in multithreading with the proper synchronization techniques.

**Example: Using `std::shared_ptr` in Multithreaded Context**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
#include <mutex>

std::mutex mtx; // Mutex for protecting shared data
std::shared_ptr<int> sharedData = std::make_shared<int>(0); // Shared integer

void increment() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        ++(*sharedData); // Increment the shared data
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        threads.emplace_back(increment);
    }

    for (auto& th : threads) {
        th.join(); // Wait for all threads to finish
    }

    std::cout << "Final shared data value: " << *sharedData << std::endl; // Should be 10000
    return 0;
}
```

### Conclusion

Multithreading in C++ is a powerful feature that allows developers to create efficient, responsive applications. By using `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::condition_variable`, and other synchronization primitives, you can effectively manage multiple threads and ensure safe access to shared resources.

**Key Points to Remember:**
- Use `std::thread` to create threads and manage their lifecycle with `join()` or `detach()`.
- Protect shared resources using `std::mutex` to avoid data races.
- Use condition variables for more complex synchronization patterns.
- Consider using `std::future` and `std::promise` for asynchronous operations.
