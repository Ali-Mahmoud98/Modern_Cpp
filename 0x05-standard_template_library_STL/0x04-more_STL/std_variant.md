# STL - `std::variant`
`std::variant` is a powerful utility introduced in C++17 that provides a type-safe way to hold a value that can belong to one of several different types. It is a part of the `<variant>` header and is often described as a type-safe union.

### Definition

`std::variant` is defined as follows:

```cpp
template <class... Types>
class variant;
```

You can think of `std::variant` as a type that can hold a value of one of the specified types, but only one value at a time.

### Key Features

1. **Type Safety**: Unlike traditional unions, `std::variant` ensures that only the type currently held can be accessed. If you try to access a type that is not currently stored, the program will not compile.

2. **Construction and Assignment**: You can construct a `std::variant` with any of its specified types. You can assign a value of any of those types to the `std::variant`, but it can only hold one value at a time.

3. **Accessing Values**:
   - You can access the currently held value using `std::get` or `std::get_if`:
     - `std::get<T>(variant)`: Accesses the value if the variant currently holds a value of type `T`. If it does not, it throws `std::bad_variant_access`.
     - `std::get_if<T>(&variant)`: Returns a pointer to the value if it is of type `T`, or `nullptr` if it is not.

4. **Indexing**: You can check which type is currently held in the variant using `std::variant_size` and `std::variant_alternative`. You can also use `std::variant_npos` to determine if the variant is currently holding a particular type.

5. **Visitation**: The `std::visit` function allows you to apply a visitor (a callable) to the current value in the variant, which can be useful for handling different types in a unified way.

6. **Comparison Operators**: `std::variant` supports comparison operators to compare the held values.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example illustrating how to use `std::variant`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <variant>
#include <string>

// Function that accepts a variant type
void printVariant(const std::variant<int, double, std::string>& var) {
    // Use std::visit to handle different types
    std::visit([](auto&& arg) {
        std::cout << "Value: " << arg << std::endl;
    }, var);
}

int main() {
    // Creating variants
    std::variant<int, double, std::string> var1 = 42;             // Holds an int
    std::variant<int, double, std::string> var2 = 3.14;           // Holds a double
    std::variant<int, double, std::string> var3 = "Hello, World"; // Holds a string

    // Printing values using the printVariant function
    printVariant(var1);
    printVariant(var2);
    printVariant(var3);

    // Accessing values
    std::cout << "Using std::get: " << std::get<int>(var1) << std::endl; // Outputs: 42

    // Attempting to get a value of a different type (will throw)
    try {
        std::cout << "Trying to get double: " << std::get<double>(var1) << std::endl;
    } catch (const std::bad_variant_access& e) {
        std::cout << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl; // Outputs an error message
    }

    // Using std::get_if
    if (auto pVal = std::get_if<double>(&var2)) {
        std::cout << "Value as double: " << *pVal << std::endl; // Outputs: 3.14
    } else {
        std::cout << "Not a double." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Practical Applications

- **Heterogeneous Collections**: `std::variant` is useful when you want to store different types in a single collection without resorting to polymorphism or base classes.

- **Type-Safe Interfaces**: You can use `std::variant` to create APIs that can handle multiple types in a type-safe manner, improving code readability and maintainability.

- **Visitor Patterns**: It can be used to implement the visitor design pattern more conveniently.

### Conclusion

`std::variant` is a powerful and flexible utility that allows you to safely manage values of multiple types. It improves type safety and reduces the chances of errors that can occur with traditional unions.
